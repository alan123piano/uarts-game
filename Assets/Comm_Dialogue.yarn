Occasionally, you will be sent a package with a new bot or structure; while some may be put to work immediately, others will need to be charged and/or assembled before use. The Pickup bot, with its gripping and agile movement capabilities, can help build these. Note, however, that during this process, it will not be able to help with any other tasks.

When new seeds appear, you can direct the Pickup bot to collect it and add it to your inventory. Later, you can plant and attempt to grow them. The green should look very nice here!

You can direct the Pickup bot to move existing plants or place them into your inventory. While in the inventory, they will be kept at the minimum survival conditions and thus will stay alive but not continue to grow. You may replant them, and they will continue to grow where they left off.

The Shovel bot can be directed to an area with surface ash or debris to clean it up. The collected waste will be collected and recycled for later human use, such as roads or building materials.

You might see ash floating in the air; the Shovel bot also has short-range vacuum capabilities to clean up this macro-particle air pollution. The collected waste will be collected and recycled for later human use, such as roads or building materials.

The humans wish to see if this planet can sustain life. The conditions of the planet as it is now are not ideal for Earth plants and human life. The Earth plants you are growing are ideal for changing the ground and atmospheric compositions to better match Earth conditions. Once the planet is clean and the conditions are ideal, this will be a very nice place for families to live.

The humans have been using this planet as a designated Trash Planet for a few years now; they eject larger pieces of junk into the atmosphere, where they burn up. Pieces often fall to the surface or create this fine metallic ash because the atmosphere is currently relatively thin. However, that can be remedied with just a few decades of the important cleanup work you are doing now!
